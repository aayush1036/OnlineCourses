# ImageClassifierTensorflow 

In this project we aim to build an image classifier using tensorflow and keras by training it on Cifar10 dataset<br>
<a href="https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html">Cifar10 dataset</a><br>

This neural network has<br>
1. Hidden layer of 128 neurons which recieves input of 32x32x3 neurons which has a relu activation function
2. Hidden layer of 64 neurons which has relu activation function 
3. Hidden layer of 16 neurons which has relu activation function 
4. Output layer of 10 neurons which has softmax activation function
<br>
In the python notebook I have experimented with dropout layers also and created 2 more models with 1 and 2 dropout layers respectively<br>
The loss metric used in this neural network was Sparse Categorical Cross Entropy <br>

For evalutation of the neural network I have used the following metrics<br>
1. Accuracy 
2. Precision 
3. Recall 
4. F-score
